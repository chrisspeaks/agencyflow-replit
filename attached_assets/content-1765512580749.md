Cloudways does not offer [server root access](https://support.cloudways.com/en/articles/5134090-why-can-t-i-have-root-access-to-my-server); however, several other options are provided to manage and tweak server settings according to your requirements using the Cloudways Platform.

## **How to Manage Your Server Settings**

[Log in to your Cloudways Platform](https://platform.cloudways.com/login) using your credentials.

1. From the top menu bar, open **Servers**.

2. Next, choose your desired server.

**Important**

The availability of the xDebug extension depends on the PHP version running on your server, as not all PHP versions support these extensions. You can learn more about the [PHP Extensions and Modules](https://support.cloudways.com/en/articles/5116170-which-base-packages-are-deployed-with-a-cloudways-server#h_07385244ef) available with your Cloudways server.

If direct access to your default web application is enabled, your website will be accessible if the server's IP address is entered into the browser instead of the domain name. On the contrary, if direct access to your default web application is disabled, your website will be inaccessible when the server's IP address is entered instead of the domain name.

2. **Default Application**— [Select or unselect the default application](https://support.cloudways.com/en/articles/5161163-how-to-block-random-domains-pointing-to-your-server).

3. **Static Cache Expiry**— Set the Expires and Cache-control response header fields (in minutes). It is set to 525600 minutes by default, which can be adjusted according to your requirements. Setting the value to '0' will disable the cache.

4. **TLS Versions**— TLS refers to [Transport Layer Security](https://support.cloudways.com/en/articles/5121355-how-to-update-the-tls-version). It is a cryptographic protocol that provides authentication, data integrity, privacy, and end-to-end communications between two devices connected over a network. By default, TLS 1.2 and 1.3 are enabled. You can [enable or disable different TLS versions](https://support.cloudways.com/en/articles/5121355-how-to-update-the-tls-version#h_631a968377) as per your requirement. Disabling TLS 1.3 is not supported.

**Locales**— Add a new System Locale in addition to the default (English\_US). To add a new System Locale, select your preferred language from the dropdown menu.

#### **Varnish**

**Cache Lifetime**— The time period for which Varnish caches content before being refreshed is called cache lifetime or Time-To-Live (TTL). The default value is set to 4 hours. You can also [change the Varnish Cache Lifetime](https://support.cloudways.com/en/articles/5496342-how-to-use-varnish-at-cloudways#h_c0b50d52a5) as per your requirement.

## **Server Packages**

Under the **Packages** tab, you can update the PHP and database versions, enable/disable Elasticsearch, and install/uninstall Supervisord. You can also read more about the [base packages deployed on your Cloudways server](https://support.cloudways.com/en/articles/5116170-which-base-packages-are-deployed-with-a-cloudways-server).

1. **[PHP](https://support.cloudways.com/en/articles/5116170-which-base-packages-are-deployed-with-a-cloudways-server#h_07385244ef)**— Your [new server](https://support.cloudways.com/en/articles/5124142-how-to-launch-a-new-application-on-a-new-server) is configured to use PHP 8.2 by default. You can always [upgrade to the latest version](https://support.cloudways.com/en/articles/5121564-how-to-upgrade-to-php-8-x-version-on-cloudways%5C), e.g., PHP 8.4, as per your requirements. Downgrading the PHP version has limitations, so you can view which [PHP versions you can upgrade or downgrade to](https://support.cloudways.com/en/articles/5121564-how-to-upgrade-to-php-8-x-version-on-cloudways). You can also check available [PHP extensions/modules](https://support.cloudways.com/en/articles/5116170-which-base-packages-are-deployed-with-a-cloudways-server#h_b7372008af) and the [application's compatibility](https://support.cloudways.com/en/articles/5121577-php-compatibility-on-cloudways-platform) with your chosen PHP version.

2. **[MySQL](https://support.cloudways.com/en/articles/5116170-which-base-packages-are-deployed-with-a-cloudways-server#h_38e66d0250)**— Our stack includes MariaDB 10.11 as the default database of your web application. You can always [upgrade to the latest version](https://support.cloudways.com/en/articles/5120689-how-to-manage-your-server-settings#h_42f7e8a1e7), e.g., MariaDB 10.11, as per your requirements. You can not downgrade MariaDB packages.

3. **[Search Engine](https://support.cloudways.com/en/articles/5120760-how-to-configure-elasticsearch-on-cloudways)**— Elasticsearch/OpenSearch is an open-source, highly available search engine custom-built for cloud servers based on the distributed restful API. The available versions are is ElasticSearch 7.17, 8.11 and OpenSearch 2.19.

4. **[Supervisord](https://support.cloudways.com/en/articles/5127434-how-to-configure-laravel-supervisord-on-cloudways)**— Supervisord is a simple, fast worker manager designed to monitor and control the processes.

5. **[RabbitMQ](https://support.cloudways.com/en/articles/8680154-how-to-enable-rabbitmq-on-cloudways)**—RabbitMQ is a versatile message broker that enables seamless communication between distributed applications. With RabbitMQ integrated into your Cloudways server, you can efficiently manage message queuing, ensuring reliable and scalable message delivery across your applications.

6. **Redis ACL** — Redis ACL (Access Control List) allows you to control and restrict access to Redis by creating users with specific permissions. With ACL, you can define which commands, keys, or patterns each user can access, enhancing security by preventing unauthorized or risky operations.


**_Tip:_**

_[Redis](http://www.cloudways.com/en/redis-hosting.php) powers up object caching through the Object Cache Pro plugin in your WordPress application. The supported version is Redis 7.0.x. By default, [new servers](https://support.cloudways.com/en/articles/5124126-how-to-add-an-application-on-the-cloudways-platform) come with Redis enabled, but you have the flexibility to manage it, including enabling or disabling Redis, through the [Manage Services section](https://support.cloudways.com/en/articles/5120718-what-can-i-do-in-the-manage-services-section)._
