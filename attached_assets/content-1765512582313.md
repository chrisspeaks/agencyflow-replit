In this article, you will learn why Cloudways does not allow root access and what is offered as an alternative to that.

## **What is the Root Account?**

The root is the username or account that by default has access to all commands and files on a Linux or other Unix-like operating system. It is also referred to as the root account, root user, and super-user.

## **Explanation of Cloudways Server Operations**

We understand the frustration that some customers face because of not having the ability to have root access to their servers. With no access, they are unable to deploy new software packages to the server, change system configuration, and so on.

What we would like to point out here is that **Cloudways** is a platform and not an isolated set of servers. Cloudways is a full network of inter-connected servers centrally orchestrated and managed, and this is one of the primary reasons for the success of Cloudways. We believe it is the only way we can reach the scale that we have in mind sustainably.

To achieve this objective, and to get the level of control we have over thousands of servers that we can manage as one, we deploy some tools and services across our server farm. These tools and services make up the neural system of our distribution network, and without them, or if they were malfunctioning, it would be impossible for us to deliver our service.

## **Why Cloudways Doesn’t Allow Root Access?**

So, it follows the answer to the main question. We can not give root access to your servers, as there is no way we can be sure that you will not break any of the tools and services that are core to our platform. Allowing direct root access would endanger the way we operate and the way we serve you.

### **How to Access Server Settings?**

We are aware that there are some standard settings and parameters that people usually change on their servers. For this, we have the **Server Settings** section.

Please follow the instructions below to access server settings:

First, navigate to the **Servers** tab from the top menu bar and select your target server.

Click on **Settings & Packages** under **Server Management**.

Here you can control **Execution Time**, **Upload Size**, **Memory Limit**, **Timezone**, etc., which would require root access to change. More information [here](https://support.cloudways.com/how-to-manage-server-settings/?utm_source=Platformkb&utm_medium=kbsearch).

We can easily add new parameters/settings that you can control, so please give your suggestions by [clicking here.](https://cloudways.uservoice.com/forums/203824-service-improvement)

We understand that this is not the replacement for root access, but it is an excellent alternative and certainly a much higher level of control than what you can find on other hosting platforms.
