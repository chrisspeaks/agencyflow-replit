Critical Bug Fix • Workbench Logic: The "My Tasks" view is currently empty. Fix the filtering logic to ensure it displays all tasks where the assignee_id matches the currently logged-in user.
Authentication & User Management • Remove Sign-Up: completely remove the public "Sign Up" option. This is an invite-only system. • Login UI: Redesign the Login page to match the high-quality aesthetic of the Landing Page. • Admin User Creation: • In the Admin Panel, add a "Create User" form (Email & Password). • Auto-Confirm: Newly created users should have their emails automatically marked as confirmed/verified (no email link required). • Force Password Change: When a user is created by an Admin, flag their account. On their very first login, force them to a "Change Password" screen before they can access the dashboard. • Admin Password Reset: • Allow Admins to manually reset any user's password to a temporary string. • If an Admin resets a password, the system must require the user to change this password immediately upon their next login.
Task Management & Kanban • New Status: Add a new status option called "Pending Client Review". • Kanban Update: Ensure this new status appears as a distinct column in the Kanban board view.
Advanced Logs & History • Data Structure: Implement a logging system for tasks that tracks: • Comments. • Status changes. • Assignee changes. • The "See Logs" UI: • Do not clutter the main view. Add a "See Logs" button/link within the Task Detail popup , one below comments, one below assigned staff. • Clicking this opens a distinct section/modal showing the full history (User, Action, Date/Time). • Assignee Log: Specifically, strictly log every time the "Assigned Staff" field is changed, recording who changed it and when.
Role-Based Permissions (RBAC) • Creation: Any authenticated user can create a task and assign it initially. • Editing Restrictions: • Core Details (Title, Priority, Due Date, Description): specific permission required. Only the Admin, Manager, or the Original Creator of the task can edit these fields. • Workflow (Comments, Status): All users can add comments and update the task status. • Assignment: Only Admins, Managers, and the Creator can re-assign the task to someone else. • UI Feedback: If a user does not have permission to edit a field (e.g., a junior staff trying to change the Due Date), that field should be read-only and greyed out
